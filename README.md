# Learning Money and Banking with React, Redux-Toolkit, D3 and Node

This site can be used to learn concepts in banking and economics, such as the evolution of central banking and money markets, or how to measure inflation.
The site will also include a game in which you get to run all aspects of a country's economy, from the Treasury and the Central Bank, to the Money Markets and Stock Exchange, all the way to International Trade, Blocs and Sovereign Debt.
Play the game or just learn through informative infographics and interactive maps and charts.
Part of an ongoing project to teach economics and the inner workings of government and finance from multiple perspectives.
This app uses React, Redux, D3 libraries, Node, Express and Sequelize...

## Long Term Project
### Site
The site will eventually be migrated to Next JS so articles contained in the site can be shared through links. The banking course will be expanded to cover international money markets, mortgage lending and federal reserve spending as well as government spending.
### Learning
The learning aspect uses an interactive UI to help teach complex concepts in an accesible way. The core concepts are indebted to the following economists and writers. Perry Mehrling, Adam Tooze, Hyman Minsky, Allyn Young. I hope to incorporate the ideas of a whole range of economists in the future, including banking and currency schools, MMT, Walter Badgehot, Karl Marx, JM Keynes, Michael Hudson, Ludwig Von Mises, Milton Friedman and Murray Rothbard.
### Game
A player chooses a country in a particular time period, managing all aspects of the economy using economic models of the given period and country. After manipulating various economic variables (eg. joining a trade bloc, running a deficit, deregulating markets), performance outcomes are given each year.
